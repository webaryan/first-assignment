                    started. I spend daily 6-8 hour to learning. Before i started this course i have no idea to
                    Web-Developer
                    or how it's work, but when i learning 3-4 days then i understand something. But i don't understand
                    properly and i cant do any website without problem. But i can't stop it i'll keep learning and one
                    day
                    i'll become a Web-Developer.</p>

                    attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence.” “The beautiful

                    pass on. Your brain has a capacity for learning that is virtually limitless, which makes every human
                    a potential genius.”</p>
